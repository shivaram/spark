This is an assembly module for Spark project.

It creates a single tar.gz file that includes all needed dependency of the project
except for org.apache.hadoop.* jars that are supposed to be available from the
deployed Hadoop cluster.

This module is off by default to avoid spending extra time on top of repl-bin
module. To activate it specify the profile in the command line
  -Passembly

In case you want to avoid building time-expensive repl-bin module, that shaders
all the dependency into a big flat jar supplement maven command with
  -DnoExpensive
